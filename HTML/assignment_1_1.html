        <h3>Assignment Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The assignment was to create a low-fidelity paper prototype of a fitness tracker app for a smartphone and smartwatch. 
            The intent was that the design was created quickly using paper so that the base features can be tested as soon as possible. 
            The base features included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A start and stop tracking input</li>
            <li>Tracker for calories burned, distance traveled and current speed</li>
            <li>Real time display of information</li>
            <li>A display for the racked information per day, week or month</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h3>Mobile Prototype:</h3>
        <img src ="../Assignment 1 Paper Proto/Mobile_1.jpeg">
        <p>
            This design features a large chart actively records data of the user's jog. 
            The data that can be live represented on this chart are speed, distance traveled and calories burned.
            These can be selected by swiping the header cycling through the three options.
            At the bottom from left to right are: A setting button (has no representation), the start and stop activity button and the overall data page.
            These various functions can be operated by taping the representative icon.
        </p>
        <img src = "../Assignment 1 Paper Proto/Mobile_2.jpeg">
        <p>
            A large chart that represents all the data collected over a period of time.
            The period of time displayed can be changed between week of the month, month of the year or overall annual performance.
            These changes can be accessed by swiping the header to which it will cycle through the options.
        </p>
        <h3>Watch Prototype:</h3>
        <img src="../Assignment 1 Paper Proto/Watch_1.jpeg">
        <p>
            The watch version is a minimized version of the mobile prototype.
            The most notable difference is rather than a live chart, there is only a live counter of the relevant data.
            All intractable functionalities are the same as the mobile, swipe for data sets and taps for navigation.
        </p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        
        <h3>Mobile Prototype</h3>
        <p>For the majority, the feedback received was positive. The functionality of elements made sense due to the design fitting mental models the testers had developed for mobile use.</p>
        <p>There were slight grievances, one was regarding the scaling of certain visuals. A factor I can’t well control in such a rushed environment and the fact I am not that good at drawing. It is something to keep in mind when improving the design in a more digital environment.</p>
        <p>A major critique was that there was no homepage or clear start to the application. This was something I excluded as I thought it wasn’t technically a functionality and hence didn’t need to be included for testing. However it affected the flow of the application so it’s important to remember for future tests of other prototypes.</p>
        <p>Lastly certain elements were only visual and featured no text to provide explanation. This was reasoned by the testers to be ok for the sake of visual clarity of the overall design of the app, but if it were to be done this way, the user would require an onboarding experience to learn what I mean with each visual.</p>
        <p>All in all valid feedback but not quite actionable to improve for a paper prototype. Either due to complexity or a level of precision that isn’t offered by pen and paper.</p>

        <h3>Watch Prototype</h3>
        <p>This prototype shared some feedback with the mobile version. Namely that it should have a home page to indicate the start of the application and improve the flow. And that certain interactions I've intended are only apparent if they were onboarded.</p>
        <p>The onboarding issue stems from how I intended that the swiping motion would be used to switch the modes of certain pages. However there were no indicators to show that this could be done so it led to me having to interfere briefly in the test.</p>

        <h3>Assignment Reflection</h3>
        <p>To conclude on this assignment, I severely dislike the use of paper prototyping. It feels more effort is required compared to simply prototyping digitally in a software like Adobe XD. The effort of having to perform arts and crafts to cut out pieces of paper and make a mock watch is a lot more tedious compared to simply dragging around squares and resizing them.</p>
        <p>Additionally making revisions based on feedback is infinitely easier as it doesn’t require recreations of entire cutouts due to one of the icons being too small or misplaced. I don’t mind the idea of sketching down how things should look or the basic progression of functionalities in a flow chart, but for the purpose of testing and revising prototypes I prefer to work digitally.</p>
        <p>So to summarize I struggled with assignments and feel like I performed a chore rather than being presented a learning opportunity.</p>
