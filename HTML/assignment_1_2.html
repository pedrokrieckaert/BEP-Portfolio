        <h3>Assignment Summary</h3>
        <p>
            For this assignment, I had to continue work on the previous assignments' fitness tracker application, to build upon it.
            We had to design non-visual feedback for core functionalities in the form of sounds.
            The required sounds were as followed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go Faster</li>
            <li>Go Slower</li>
            <li>Sip some water</li>
            <li>Exercise complete / milestone reached</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Sounds</h3>
        <p>To preface, I believed all the sounds were appropriate to their function based on the fact that users were onboarded to the meanings of the sounds before using the application.</p>
        
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>
            The prototype was evaluated by means of roleplaying a jog. The user would "jog" and I'd play different sounds seeing if they'd react to it with the appropriate function.
            So if I played the go faster sound, the user would go faster. The problem with this test was that the users were told what each sound means, so it became more of a test of memory.
            I believe this is fine as audio feedback rarely mirrors the world sounds associated with an action.
            <br>
            What I asked for feedback and found value in is if the sounds were distinct enough from each other and easily recognizable.
        </p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Assignment Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            This assignment was rather easy, although I feel like there could have been more depth.
            That being said so far we haven't received a dedicated course on audio design as it has been strictly visual.
            This means that the depth, quality and reasoning to my design would be very shallow.
            Regardless I thought of it as an interesting change of pace, a shame that I couldn't make use of the workshop time and resources due to hardware limitations.
            <br>
            I'd have to say my largest challenge when undergoing this assignment was whether or not my testing and results were appropriate.
            I feel this is because the peers I tested on can only base their feedback on prior examples of sounds they've heard in other systems.
            So more comparison than actual detailed and theory / pattern based theory.
            <br>
            I'd like to conclude with a recommendation that this assignment be changed to further educate about techniques or topics we'd have covered in other courses, as this is the only outlier.
