        <h3>Assignment Summary</h3>
        <p>
            For this assignment we had to test the functionality for a new exciting ang engaging sign-up process.
            I chose to create a design loosely based on Facebook's sign up process.
            Additionally it was suggested to use a new design tool for this assignment, so I made mine using InVision.
        </p>
        <p>The requirements for the sign-up process are as followed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Welcome Screen</li>
            <li>Gathering of personal information
                <ul>
                    <li>First and second name</li>
                    <li>Email</li>
                    <li>Password</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A waiting screen of at least 10 seconds</li>
            <li><i>Extra: any other additional elements</i></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Note: The updated designs come from assignment 2.2, they will have a greater fidelity, however it still shows the basic updated functionality.</i>
        </p>
        
        <h4>Information Step</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Original</p>
        <img src = "../Assignment 2 Wireframe/Index.jpg">
        <p>
            The original is designed to heavily resemble the typical sign up process, all information up front.
            I tried to design this as basically as possible with the only guide as to what to fill in being the placeholder text.
            I also included a password strength meter as it appears on just about every other sign-up process.
        </p>

        <img src = "../Assignment 2_HiFi/screenshots/password.PNG">
        <img src = "../Assignment 2_HiFi/screenshots/password2.PNG">

        <p>
            The revised version was created with the strongest point of feedback in mind; the user may be overloaded with information and easily bored.
            So I split each input to it's own step, this also allowed for the opportunity of further personalizing the experience by incorporating the user's inputs into the design.
            Additionally, making the instructions more motivational rather than informational was also a point of feedback for keeping the user engaged.
        </p>

        <h4>Verify Email Step</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Original</p>
        <img src = "../Assignment 2 Wireframe/Verify Email.jpg">
        <p>Once again based on standard practice of receiving a verification link via email.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Revised</p>
        <img src = "../Assignment 2_HiFi/screenshots/email2.PNG">
        <p>
            This was based on an interesting point of feedback, rather than force the user to open multiple additional tabs they can leave it only at 2 tabs by having to input a code rather than clicking another link.
            Additionally there was a desire for an option to display the email, just in case the wrong email was typed, and to go back and change it if necessary.
        </p>

        <h4>10 Second Wait step</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Original</p>
        <img src = "../Assignment 2 Wireframe/10s Pause.jpg">
        <p>
            The intent behind this was to keep the user occupied with a minor bit of fun.
            The user could use the space bar to make the balls bounce, something novel to kill 10 seconds of time spent.
            This was appreciated although there was some interesting feedback.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Revised</p>

        <p>
            This revision was largely based on the idea of further personalizing the experience for the user.
            The tip given was that user will spent large amounts of time perfecting their avatar to represent them.
            This presented to interesting options for design, the first was an avatar system which I couldn't fully realise due to programing limitations.
            The second was giving the user an additional task related to signing-up while they wait.
            Plus to reflect how user will want to take their time customizing, I made the wait time somewhat visible with a progress bar that once filled will not force you to continue.
            Only once the user has deemed they are finished, can they press the continue button.
        </p>

        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>
            Testing for the wireframes were simple, testees we're tasked with going through the prototype without my intervention.
            They were free to ask for help if anything was unclear.
            After testing I asked for feedback specifically with the waiting screen, after that I asked them for anything they'd like to give feedback about the rest of the prototype.
            <br>
            The results of the tests were as follows:
            <br>
            All in all the functionality flow is good and the actions are mostly clear, it's just missing a personalization aspect to the process.
            Specifically however:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify email needs better security like seeing the inputted email and having the ability to change it.</li>
            <li>The verify email page should be about inputting a code rather than opening another link.</li>
            <li>Some people have long names, the input field for names should be one instead of 2 which only limits it to first and last name.</li>
            <li>Waiting page needs more "Wow".</li>
            <li>Needs a homepage.</li>
            <li>Input page is displaying and asking for too much information at once, consider segmenting the inputs.</li>
            <li>Personalize the experience with the user's inputs.</li>
            <li>Include a direct feature for personalization like an avatar creation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Assignment Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            I used InVision to develop the wireframes for this assignment overall I must say I am not a fan of the program.
            I can appreciate how robust it's auto-animate feature is compared to Adobe XD's however I still prefer Adobe XD.
            While the two share a lot of features, Adobe XD is developing much faster and is included more minor details to improve prototyping.
            A big boon to Adobe XD is to allow for online co-editing which great and efficient for group assignments.
            <br>
            What I did learn from using InVision is that going between these prototyping softwares isn't too difficult.
            Only a slight learning curve in regards to how things are named and the iconography.
            This is important as in the working field not all business might use Adobe XD so being adaptable to their preferred platform will be a good skill.
        </p>
        <p>
            Testing wise I noticed what I reflected on back in assignment 1.1, there is less confusion to the intent of functions due to artistic limitations.
            I was able to get detailed feedback because of this and adapting most of these minor changes between tests lead for good actionable feedback for the next assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, I will be using prototyping software to lay out wireframes of design to test functionality and flow in the future.
            The ability for the design to be misinterpreted as little as possible is great and the ability to quickly adjust the design based on feedback will allow for an overall more efficient workflow.
        </p>
