        <h3>Assignment Summary</h3>
        <p>
            For this assignment I had to create a High Fidelity prototype using the wireframes from assignment 2.1 as the backbone.
            The intent is that we provide an application with the look and feel of a final product.
            So the visual elements of the prototype must be coherent.
        </p>
        <h3>Hi-Fi Prototype</h3>
        <h3 style = "text-align: center;"><a href = "../Assignment 2_HiFi/build/index.html" target = "_blank">Link to the prototype</a></h3>
        <p>
            I used HTML/CSS/JavaScript with the ReactJS framework to develop this prototype.
            <br><i>Note: There is a bug during the email step of the sign-up, the password gets carried over and is auto filled in the input for the email.</i>
            <br> For the screenshot, see the appendix B bellow.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the Hi-fi design I wanted to act as much as possible on the personalization aspect of the feedback received.
            So I put a lot of effort in variable text that will display the user's input name, email and so forth.
            Additionally I wanted to include micro-comments to help keep the user engaged on the task, which I saw the a good opportunity to put those inputs in.
            <br>
            I also made the effort of splitting all the inputs to their own steps as to not overload the user with information.
            This did present a challenge as essentially increased the steps the user had to undertake.
            I do believe my implementation of personalization and micro-comments alleviate this issue.
            <br>
            I also included the security requested for the email verification step.
            This is done by including the micro-comments that has the inputted email as part of it's text.
            Also a back button to go to the prior step to change the email.
            Additionally the email is verified through a code rather than external link sent to the user's email.
            <br>
            Lastly the biggest change, the balls from wireframe prototype have been done away.
            It's replaced with an avatar selection page, while I had hopped to be able to create a system with a customizable avatar.
            However I'm no expert at ReactJS so this idea was out of my reach, however I still wanted to preserve the concept of the avatar creation.
            Also rather than a hidden timer, a loading bar that takes 10 seconds to load will fill up to indicate how far the behind the scenes operation is.
            When it's filled, rather than automatically continuing the flow, the user themselves must choose when to continue.
            This to compensate for the potential amount of time a user might spend to select an avatar.
        </p>

        <h3>Testing and Results</h3>
        <p>
            The test was conducted with a non-intrusive approach, unless the user is stuck and asks for help.
            They are tasked with completing the sign-up process.
            Once completed I asked them about the general flow of the sign-up and whether they got bored during the 10 second wait period.
            I also asked for any additional feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
            The results I received were mixed, this can be due to how a few test subjects aren't in the UX course.
            However it offers an interesting insight, that while we may be pushing to change experiences and norms for design, simply sticking to working standard can satisfy the majority of users.
            This is largely referencing how all the inputs are segmented rather than put into a single page form, this feedback come from users who are competent when using the computer..
            <br>
            Overall aesthetically, testers reacted positively with minor adjust such as disabling a button or adjust an interaction.
            <br>
            As for the 10 second waiting page, overall users reacted positively too.
            They appreciated having a task to do, albeit kind off shallow, but it occupied the time.
            The bar was also a tangible display of the time passing which was also appreciated.
            <br>
            In sum my prototype is heading in the right direction.
        </p>

        <h3>Assignment Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            I believe I made an error in creating the Hi-fi prototype using ReactJS. 
            While it did allow me to create the more personalized experience requested in the wireframe feedback, it was quite the hassle for a prototype.
            I would expect to do this for a more technical oriented prototyping and testing.
            <br>
            What I was able to learn is that too much is expected from a prototype that most prototyping software just can't afford.
            It's these variable interactions that are highly appreciated but very hard to represent in a prototype.
            I would hope that for future iterations of this course, expectancies of error proofing and variable personalization be kept for more technical courses.
            Although I must relent for this assignment as it did technically ask for a final product like feel.
            <br>
            I didn't learn to much from this assignment, I just felt that questions were more oriented towards pixel pushing rather than functionality and flow.
            Still it is important to learn how to ask for feedback regarding small aesthetic changes.
