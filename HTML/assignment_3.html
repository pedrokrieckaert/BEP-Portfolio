        <h3>Assignment Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The assignment was to test a self made hypothesis regarding a type of bias a user could face.
            The hypothesis would have to be tested using AB testing; this is where the subject is presented with two variations of a prototype.
            Between the variations only one variable has changed, from this the user's behavior is observed.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Topic</h3>
        <p>
            For my AB test I decided to do it on the provided topic of Picture Superiority Effect.
            This refers to how pictures and imagery are likely to be remembered better than just words.
        </p>

        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
            My hypothesis for this topic is: User's are more likely to remember the images over words.
        </p>

        <h3>Testing Method</h3>
        <p>
            To test this I created two variations of the YouTube layout the variations will either have 8 unaffiliated images (variant A) or 8 bodies of text describing imagery (variant B), these description will be unrelated to variant A's images as to avoid bias.
            The testee will observe image variant (variant A) for 15 seconds, then the variant will be removed and the testee is tasked with describing the 8 images with as much detail as possible.
            Then the testee will observe the text variant (variant B) for 15 seconds, after which the testee will recite the texts as best as they can.
            <br>
            Measurements will be based on how well the details of each image and text are described, if an image or text is described too broadly then it will not count.
            For each accurate description a point is tallied, the variant with the most points serves to prove which is more memorable.
            <br>
            Lastly, the testees' feedback will be asked for discovery of potential anomalies or additional errors in the testing method.
        </p>

        <h3>Prototype Variants</h3>
        <h3 style = "text-align: center;"><a href = "../Assignment 3 AB Testing/test_a.html" target="_blank">Variant A</a></h3>
        <h3 style = "text-align: center;"><a href="../Assignment 3 AB Testing/test_b.html" target="_blank">Variant B</a></h3>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            My hypothesis has been proved with my results.
            <br>
            Given the short amount of time, the user were able to focus on one aspect of the image presented to them and recall that.
            Where as for the text it would seem they were compelled to read as many details as instructed only to forget most of it.
            Probably if they were given more time, they'd be able to remember just as many bodies of text as images or more even.
            <br>
            My take away from this is if something needs be made memorable quickly it's best for there to be some imagery associated with it as the user may have an easier time describing it.
        </p>

        <h3>Assignment Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            I feel this a very interesting method of testing.
            I believe that this method has a strong means of settling a dispute between two designs with one varying change.
            However to AB test on every possible variable isn't efficient, it should be reserved for large concepts and theories of design that can affect the design as a whole.
            I would to try an AB test that isn't limited to small variable change or a limited testing period, something really big to truly measure it's effectiveness.
