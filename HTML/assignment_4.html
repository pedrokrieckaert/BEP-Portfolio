        <h3>Assignment Summary</h3>
        <p>
            For this assignment I had to create a prototype which would use bodily movements as inputs.
            However this functionality won't be created, instead using a webcam the user go on to make their bodily inputs, but in fact I control the prototype in response to their inputs.
        </p>

        <h3>The Wizard of Oz prototype</h3>
        <p>
            Concept: Hungry Snake
            <br>
            A snake, traveling in a straight line, must reach food without eating itself.
            It grows longer after each food it eats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scenario
            <br>
            When the user stretches their arm in one of the four cardinal directions, except the opposite one the snake is traveling, the snake will turn towards that direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Interface Elements
            <br>
            Snake, Food, Grid map
        </p>
        <p>
            Wizard Input
            <br>
            Every time the user stretches their arm in an appropriate direction, the wizard will change the direction of the snake using the W (up) A (left) S (down) D (right) keys.
        </p>

        <h3>Prototype Tools and Testing</h3>
        <p>
            Processing 3 will be used to create the prototype as it can be used to quickly create a small game-like prototype.
            <br>
            This prototype will be screen shared from my screen in a video conference software.
        </p>

        <h3>Assignment Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            I think this is an interesting technique to use in the future and it somewhat answers a concern I faced in prior assignments.
            At time there are functionalities for a design that cannot be prototyped due to software limitations, however if it is critical to the flow then it still must be tested.
            Wizard of Oz prototyping can be the solution for situations that require complex user inputs, like body movement, or a very variable experience for user personalization.
            <br>
            However, I feel that if the prototype doesn't use mechanical inputs (like key strokes), then setting up a Wizard of Oz test can be very tedious work as well as during the test.
            Still, it is better to do some tedious work and come out with a low cost design that can be tested rather than doing a lot of programming to get the functionality working as designed and then still having to test it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I reused and old processing program I made back in the programming bootcamp.
            I saw that it could fit this assignment as there was no element that need changing only the context of it's use.
            Still to reflect on the process of creating this back in the bootcamp, it was tricky.
            Creating the code for the snake's body to trail behind it in the exact path it has traveled required serious usage of arrays.
        </p>
