            Overall I thought that this course was very interesting, it had a few assignments which I felt could have done without, and others that were very insightful.
            I particularly enjoyed the wireframe and Hi-fi prototyping, if the course could have been a more logical flow centering around these assignments I think I would have gained the most from it.
            Techniques like paper prototyping I felt were a waste, they require a lot of effort for something with the intent of being completed within a few minutes.
            Rushing a prototype like this invites bad feedback which essentially questions your artistic capabilities to represent functionalities.
            Additionally iterating upon feedback is a chore itself as it would require redrawing the entire piece it was referring too.
            As stated in my reflection for assignment 1.1, I would much rather go straight to a digital prototype for usability testing and flow evaluation.
            <br>
            To conclude, not a technique I'm likely to use again.
            <br><br>
            The non-visual prototype I felt was like a fun fact deviation. All assignments, aside from this one, felt like a natural extension to the other courses we had through out the year.
            However this one was an entirely new subject no one had taught us. I felt that the knowledge is out weighed by the effort we put into this.
            Ultimately it wasn't an assignment I took to heart as I felt there was little cary over for future use. Unless I intended to become a sound designer, then this assignment served as a good basis.
            <br>
            For next year I would suggest replacing this with another step for the wireframe and Hi-fi prototyping, as this was too much time spent not learning anything I see my self using.
            <br><br>
            The wireframe assignment was interesting but could use some better clarification on the term wireframe.
            Had I known I could use conventional rules of wireframing to create the first prototype I would have.
            But instead I ended up spending too much time creating something that was between a wireframe and a Hi-fi prototype.
            Regardless this is ultimately my fault and I learned a little more about creating quick digital prototypes.
            It only helped me to favor it more over paper prototyping.
            <br>
            Advice for next year is that the core requirement of this assignment be changed from making a fun and engaging 10 second wait screen.
            I believe prototyping tools like InVision or Adobe XD do not have the capabilities to properly demonstrate a designer's idea to solve this.
            Any attempt to do it in these software is likely to lead to something lack luster like my bouncing balls, or an idea that would really require a tester's imagination to realise it.
            Since this was our first real interaction with wireframe prototypes, maybe just sticking to prototyping a sign up process and making that exciting as a whole, rather than shoehorning in a gimmick to design around.
            I can't remember the last time there was an explicit wait time for me to receive an account after filling in my information. 
            <br><br>
            I don't think I can give proper critical feedback about the Hi-fi assignment, I made it needlessly difficult by using the ReactJS framework to create my prototype.
            I did appreciate the opportunity to create something with a near final product look and being able to test for small things in aesthetic or function.
            This would have been all the more better if there wasn't the gimmick of designing an engaging experience around waiting 10 seconds.
            <br>
            One change I can think of is tied to the suggestion for assignment 1.2.
            The jump from just wireframes to a final product like look is a little too large in my opinion.
            If there was an assignment that bridged this gap, then it would make it greater learning experience.
            Working with same design but altering it after subsequent user tests is very close link to real world practice.
            I think this is a very good learning opportunity that isn't currently present.
            <br><br>
            AB testing was an interesting discovery, I really like the idea of testing two fundamental aspects of one design to determine which better overall.
            I have stated a lot of what I feel about this assignment in the reflection there.
            But, to reiterate, I feel that AB testing is most valuable if it testing large concepts like the Picture superiority effect.
            Large changes that can change the look of the entire design, rather than one small component of it.
            It is a very time consuming testing method as it would require the creation of two variations of the prototype.
            Ideally this an alright expense in wireframe prototypes as they do not have a significant amount of detail that needs to be accounted for between the two variations of the design.
            <br>
            All in all, a very useful assignment with a technique I intend to use in the future.
            <br><br>
            Lastly the Wizard of Oz testing.
            I found this to be an interesting testing method, it allows for very complex user controls for relatively simple functionalities to be tested.
            Personally it isn't something I see much use to be used in the future as I'm fairly confident I'm able to create design that the user can interact with directly.
            Especially with how far some of the prototyping programs have come you can test functionalities for phone that could only have been done with paper or the Wizard of OZ test.
            Despite this I think this was an interesting enough learning experience and it may be useful somewhere down the line.
            <br>
            I believe an interesting change to the course could be about dedicating to one design but learning a variety of testing methods.
            For example, I would never have known about the AB testing without this course.
            With a course like that I believe I could have learned so much more, it can easily account for my suggestion regarding the paper prototype assignment.
            <br><br>
            In summary, I thought that this was a very educational course, and with a few minor adjustments for next year can serve to be very great learning opportunity.
